# Crux Product Phase Execution Protocol

This protocol is now the operating rule for every remaining Crux productization phase.

## Required Phase Loop

Every phase must complete these steps before it is considered done:

1. Implement the phase fully within its stated scope.
2. Test the phase with focused tests, E2E-style workflow coverage, and smoke tests where applicable.
3. Validate the implementation against the phase spec.
4. Generate durable artifacts: spec, trace log, changelog, and any user-facing documentation.
5. Report the phase as done and name the next phase.

## Current Phase Status

- Phase 09: Source File Upload Workspace, implemented in Studio v0.6.
- Phase 10: Answer-First Decision Brief, implemented in Studio v0.7.
- Phase 11: Async Run Lifecycle, implemented in Studio v0.8.
- Phase 12: Durable Lifecycle Recovery, implemented in Studio v0.9.
- Phase 13: Evidence Gap Closure Loop, implemented in Studio v0.10.

## Next Phase

Phase 14: Decision Delta Report.

Goal:

- Make before/after run movement readable as a decision delta: what changed, why trust moved, which evidence closed gaps, and what still blocks readiness.

Why this is next:

- Studio can now close evidence gaps and rerun. The next product gap is making the improvement legible enough that a user can confidently explain why the newer run is better.
